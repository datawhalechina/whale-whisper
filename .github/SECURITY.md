# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in WhaleWhisper, please do **not** open a public issue with exploit details.

## Preferred: GitHub Security Advisories

Use the repository’s **Security → Advisories** feature to report privately (if enabled).

## If advisories are not available

Open an issue with **high-level** information only (no exploit, no tokens/keys, no sensitive logs), and state that you are requesting a private channel for full details.

## Sensitive data

Before sharing logs/configs, please redact:
- API keys / tokens
- Access credentials
- Private URLs / internal IPs
- Personal data
